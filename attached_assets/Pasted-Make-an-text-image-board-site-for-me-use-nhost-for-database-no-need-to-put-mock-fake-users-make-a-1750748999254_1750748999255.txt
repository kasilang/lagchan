Make an text/image board site for me! use nhost for database, no need to put mock/fake users, make a specific thread for /text/ or Green-Text. this is anonymous everyone is anon, make sure image posts just like in futaba, also when someone first goes to the home page there's a closable chat bubble that says. "Ako nga pala si Ka Silang. Sole proprietor, site admin, webdev, at designated theorist-in-residence.
Mahal ko ang dialectical materialism at pusa. Yung literal at yung metaphorical.
Enjoy mo to habang libre pa. Pag nainis ako, magiging .onion na lang to."
